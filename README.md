# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description
The code is set up with a function with four different variables to place within the JS code with uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numerical digits. I also added a couple of newly researched pieces of code such as the isNaN code, and the !variable which is able to help with the boolean functions. In order to ensure that each variable shows up at least one time in any given generated password. That is displayed in the variable for the substring and the if statements of each "includes character". The next big thing that enables the codes to work is the determination of the password is unable to be generated by none of the selections being true by using the afformentioned !variable tags. This is also demonstrated in a console log in order to show whether or not it is true or false. With all of these in succession, it enables the code to work without trouble. Another great alternative to doing the prompts would be to do a check box feature and the input box in order to put in how many characters and to check off which variables you want to show up in your generated password.

The biggest thing that I have learned from this project is to learn as much as you could from the modules, but sometimes self-study is a great remedy to figure out where you get stuck. Getting help from people in your references who know what they are doing in order to explain hard concepts to you. That was the biggest hurdle to overcome for me in this one was to simply understand what each individual function did. When someone else gave me one-on-one explanations and helped me answer a lot of personal questions, it was much easier to understand and organize my code in a manner that was readable and concise and correct.
