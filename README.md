# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description
This was taken from a source code, cloned, and developed separately. This assignemnt was to condense the source code into more of a readability for other coders as well as make it more accessible for those with vision or hearing impairments. These changes included changing div tags into sections as well as changing some of the class names that had similar CSS codes into one section in order to make it easier to read and less crowded. There were also several dots that had to be change due to div's being taken away and changed with header and footer tags. I also added the alt tags to the images and the links to describe what the image is or what the link does in order for programs to be able to read out what it is for someone who has impairments and is attempting to read the site. 

I learned from this assignment to be patient, to read each section by its blocks, not as its whole. Using the side-by-side feature in VS Code helped a lot as I went line by line to see what was similar, taking my time and looking at the code to ensure I was looking at it correctly. It was also helpful to utilize the assistance of fellow classmates as well as tutors.
